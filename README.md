# Ebill-Calculator
Calculates electricity bill of consumer by fetching data from the database.

The State Electricity Board was finding it difficault to deal with the billing process of their domestic consumers. Validating the consumer number, making a note of  the respective units consumed, calculating the bill amount based on the units consumed, and other  processes were done manually which was very time consuming. 

Here, a software is proposed to automate their work.

Scope of the project:
1.	Parse data and generate a bill for all the customer
2.	Store the ElectricityBill of each customer
