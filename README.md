# Ebill-Calculator
Calculates electricity bill of consumer by fetching data from the database.

The State Electricity Board was finding it tough to deal with the billing process of their domestic consumers. Validating the consumer number, making a note of  the respective units consumed, calculating the bill amount based on the units consumed, and other  processes were done manually  which was very time consuming.  So, the Electricity Board decides to out source the billing process of their domestic consumers to Global Tek Software Company. Help the Global Tek to automate the above task.

Scope of the project:
1.	Parse data and generate a bill for all the customer
2.	Store the ElectricityBill of each customer
